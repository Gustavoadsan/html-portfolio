<h2>My favorite movies of all time (up until now at least)</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Shrek 2</h3>
<p>I simply love how awesome and fun this movie is, I can watch it a million times and not get tired of it.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is the first movie I watched in IMAX, it was incredible, the music and specially the way they portrait the space is so beautiful that it has stuck with me until this day.</p>

<h3>It</h3>
<p>This is one of my fravorite movies ever since I finished reading the book, and because I loved it so much, I ended up liking the movie a lot as well.</p>
